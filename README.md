Hi, My Name is Shaqib.

I’m using github to store my projects for embedded system development which includes STM32, ESP32, Raspberry Pi and Arduino board.

Among projects that have been created are:

1. WAVE (sound) File Recorder using Arduino Uno 
- This project records sound from external input and create WAVE type file in the SD Card attached to the Arduino.
- Hardware: Arduino Uno, potentiometer & SD card reader module.

2. Watch using STM32F407 Discovery Board 
- This project set and read time & date extracted from RTC module using I2C communication and send it to LCD Display 16x2.
- Hardware: STM32F407 Discovery Board, RTC Tiny Module, LCD Display 16x2
